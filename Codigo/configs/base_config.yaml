# REACTIVE NAVIGATION
# General evaluation / showcase configuration
# Developed by Luna Jimenez Fernandez
#
# This file contains all general parameters to be used while evaluating 
# or showcasing the trained agents.
# 
# In addition, the contents of this file are also used as a basis for the configuration
# used while training the agents. Training specific parameters can be found in the 
# method-specific files (such as reactive_pointnav_train.yaml)
#
# Finally, some of the parameters are specified via arguments during program launch:
#	- Agent type
#	- Dataset and splits to be used
#	- Path to pre-trained weights
